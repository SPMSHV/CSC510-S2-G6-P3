# 🍽️ A Quick Start Guide to BiteCode

**BiteCode** brings together food delivery and competitive programming in a unique, gamified experience. 

It allows users and competitive programmers to **order food and earn rewards** — getting **discounts on every order** through quick problem-solving challenges.  

After placing an order, the clock starts ticking ⏱️ — **solve a coding question before your delivery partner arrives** to earn **up to 20% off** your order!  

It’s where every byte earns you a bite!

---

## 🚀 Overview

BiteCode has been developed as part of CSC510 - Software Engineering project at NC State University to demonstrate the design and implementation of an interactive, dual-purpose web platform.

This repository (proj3) extends the original BiteCode project (proj2) with 9 new milestones, building upon the foundation created by the previous team.

### Previous Work (proj2)
The original BiteCode project was developed by Team sec2_g3 and included:
- Complete multi-role food delivery system (customers, restaurants, drivers)
- Judge0 integration for coding challenges with dynamic rewards
- Automated coupon application system
- Role-specific dashboards with responsive design
- Modular backend architecture with comprehensive testing

### Current Work (proj3)
This repository extends proj2 with 9 new milestones:
1. **Adaptive Challenge Difficulty** - Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on user performance
2. **Chess Engine Integration** - Chess puzzles as alternative to coding challenges
3. **Geolocation Tracking** - Real-time driver location and ETA calculation
4. **UI/UX & Stability Enhancements** - Performance optimizations and UI consistency
5. **Payment & Security Upgrades** - Payment verification, refunds, and audit trails
6. **Email Notifications** - Order status update emails
7. **Order Rating System** - Customer ratings and reviews
8. **Search & Filter Enhancements** - Advanced search for restaurants and menu items
9. **Analytics Dashboard** - Restaurant and system-wide analytics

It combines two main components:

1. **Food Delivery Application**  
   A full-stack web app built using **MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js (MERN)**.  
   It enables users to discover restaurants, browse menus, place orders, and participate in timed coding challenges or chess puzzles that unlock instant rewards.

2. **Judge0 Frontend**  
   A React-based interface powered by the open-source **Judge0 API**, used to compile and execute code in real time.  
   This module handles the challenge portion — validating code submissions and dynamically calculating rewards or discounts based on user performance.

The repository also includes an **Archived** directory that stores earlier prototypes, development scripts, and reference materials used during the design phase.

## 👥 Intended Users

- **Foodies & Customers** – who want to enjoy meals while participating in quick coding challenges to earn discounts.  
- **Competitive Programmers** – who love solving problems under real-world time pressure (literally racing the delivery timer).  
- **Developers & Students** – interested in exploring full-stack application design and API integration.  
- **Educators** – who want to adapt the concept into interactive classroom experiences combining logic and engagement.

## 🌟 Why Choose Our Project?
[![Watch the demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/kKXPadUnOhY/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kKXPadUnOhY)

Our project — **BiteCode** — blends **Food Delivery**, **Gamified Coding Challenges**, and an **Interactive Judge0 Frontend** into one cohesive full-stack system.  
It’s not just a project to run — it’s a project you can *grow*, *extend*, and *learn from*.

### 🚀 Why It’s Worth Contributing
- **Modern Tech Stack:**  
  Built with **MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, Bootstrap, and Jest**, it offers hands-on experience across the entire MERN stack — plus real API integration with **Judge0**, making it ideal for full-stack and DevOps learners alike.

- **Strong Foundation, Easy to Extend:**  
  The modular backend and decoupled frontend make adding new ideas seamless — you can go beyond food delivery.  
  💡 *Example:* Replace coding challenges with your **chess engine** — users could solve chess puzzles to earn discounts and rewards, leveraging the same “challenge” architecture!

- **Comprehensive Testing (161 Tests!):**  
  The system is battle-tested with **161 Jest + Pytest testcases**, covering:
  - Customer, restaurant, driver, and payment workflows  
  - Coupon and challenge APIs  
  - Frontend UI interactions and API integration  
  - Judge0 backend execution scenarios across multiple languages  
  - Core edge cases: authentication guards, invalid inputs, runtime/compile errors  
  This extensive coverage ensures stability and a reliable foundation for future enhancements.

### ✨ Completed Enhancements (proj3)
All of the following features have been implemented in this repository:

1. **✅ Adaptive Challenge Difficulty:**  
   Dynamically adjusts coding (or chess) challenge difficulty based on a user's **order frequency, accuracy, and past performance**.

2. **✅ Chess Engine Integration:**  
   Integrated chess.js library — users can solve chess puzzles to **earn discounts** on their orders, with puzzles available in easy, medium, and hard difficulties.

3. **✅ Driver Geolocation Tracking:**  
   HTML5 Geolocation API integration enables live **driver location tracking**, ETA calculation, and real-time order tracking.

4. **✅ UI/UX & Stability Enhancements:**  
   Improved responsiveness, performance optimizations, standardized UI components, and enhanced dashboard consistency.

5. **✅ Payment & Security Upgrades:**  
   Payment verification, **refund management**, secure transaction logs, and **audit trails** for all critical operations.

6. **✅ Email Notifications:**  
   Automated email notifications for order confirmations and status updates.

7. **✅ Order Rating System:**  
   Customer rating and review system with separate food and delivery ratings.

8. **✅ Search & Filter Enhancements:**  
   Advanced search with filters for restaurants and menu items.

9. **✅ Analytics Dashboard:**  
   Comprehensive analytics for restaurants and system-wide insights.

### 📈 Code Quality & Coverage
- **Extensive Testing:** 122 unit, integration, and end-to-end testcases across JavaScript (all passing).  
- **Backward Compatibility:** All existing functionality from proj2 maintained and tested.  
- **Structured Documentation:** Each module (models, routes, utilities, and frontend tests) has detailed documentation.  
- **Clear Contribution Path:** Well-defined `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` files guide newcomers through setup and best practices.
